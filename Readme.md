# What have I learned

This was the first project where I made Ajax calls to a web api and get the specific data I want from the api. By setting up Gulp, I could see the changes that I make without refreshing the page everytime, and also it would tell me where the error was comming from so by reading the comment I coudl figure out what went wrong in my code. Using SCSS for styles helped me to simplify my code keep it more organized partially. So whenever I had to change my style, I could just go to a specific partial instead of looking through my entire code.
